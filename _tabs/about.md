  <h2>Let's Get Personal</h2>

  <p>If you made it all the way to this page: thank you! You're probably here because you want to know a bit more about Juan, the person. So, let’s get personal.</p>

  <p>My name is Juan Carlos Rangel Barco — and if you're wondering, “Why so many names?” you wouldn’t be the first. I was born and raised in Colombia, where you inherit both your dad’s and mom’s last names.</p>

  <p>From a young age, I was drawn to animation and games. Around age 14, I heard about BYU’s animation program and made it my goal to join it one day. I spent the next couple of years teaching myself English until I was proficient enough, then moved to the U.S. to study at BYU. I am now a permanent resident of the US.</p>

  <p>At BYU, I studied Computer Science and was accepted into the Animation and Games emphasis. My journey through the program was a life-changing experience — my professors and classmates were some of the most excellent people I’ve met, and I’ll always be thankful for what they taught me. Among those lessons, the most valuable was the art of teamwork.</p>

  <p>During my studies, I trained with tools such as Autodesk Maya, Adobe Substance Painter, SideFX Houdini, and Unreal Engine 5. I also developed skills in programming languages including C++, C, Python, and Java. I would love to work on a project that requires mastery of one or more of those.</p>

  <p>As you might expect, I’m something of a geek myself. Video games are a big part of my life, and I use them to stay connected with people. In my free time, I play locally with my wife and online with friends back home. I also enjoy drawing, programming mini-games, watching movies with my wife and our cat, discovering new music, and a good hike. Feel free to use the contact tab to send me your favorite movie recommendations!</p>
