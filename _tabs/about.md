    If you made it all the way to this page: thank you! You are probably here becuase you want to know some more about Juan, the person. So let's get personal.<br><br>

    My name is Juan Carlos Rangel Barco, and if you're wondering: why so many names? You would not be the first one. I was born and raised in Colombia, where you inherited both your dad's and mom's last names. From a young age, I've shown interest for animation and games. Around age 14, I heard about BYU's animation program and made it my goal to join it one day. I spent the next couple years teaching myself English until I was profficient enough, then I came to the US to study at BYU. <br><br>

    At BYU, I studied computer science and got accepted to the animation and games emphasis. My journey in the animation program was life-changing experience, my professors and classmates were the most excellent people, and I will be forever thankful for what they taught me, including the most precious skill there is: team work. I was trained to use software such as Autodesk Maya, Adobe Substance Painter, sideFx Houdini, and Unreal Engine 5, along with languages like C++, C, Python and Java, and I would love to work on an endevour that requires mastery of one or more of those.<br><br>

    As you should expect, I am something of a geek myself. Video games are an important part of my life and I try to use them to connect with people. On my free time, I play locally with my wife and online with my friends from back home. I also enjoy drawing, programming mini-games, watching movies with my wife and our cat, discovering new music, and a good hike. Feel free to use the <a href="../contact" target="_new">contact</a> tab to send me movie recommendations. <br><br>
